# Awesome Tips & Tricks ðŸ˜Ž

- Capacitorjs is really great to go from webapp to mobile app in almost no time.
- The fastest way to test changes on mobile devices is with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can create a tunnel/link to your local machine and then test in the web browser of any device.
- Safari has a pretty neat sync between iOS devices and mac. Can be used to debug mobile. It's most convenient to use over wifi. Just need to set it up with a couple of clicks. Instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZmD7asfpQ).
- Puppeteer is a great way to create thumbnail images of something. That way you can use your web & css skills to create things like icons and then convert to jpg format with puppeteer! See [icongenerator5000](./generators/icongenerator5000.ts).
- If you want to publish an app to App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android), plan at least a week in for the review process.
- If you upload apps to "App Store Connect" (apples platform for devs to release apps), and uploads fail without much information (just saying ERROR), reupload again with a tool called "Transporter". It gives more detailed error messages.
- I'm quite happy that I published "Svelte Puzzle" as my first apps for iOS and Android. It's much better to get some experience with the releasing rather than going for a release of a "big app" that's important to you right away!
- This is my code for handling touch [./src/routes/touch.ts](./src/routes/touch.ts) . It is an essential ingredient of making a web app compatible for mobile release.
- Also check out [./src/app.html](./src/app.html) and [./src/styles/app.scss](./src/styles/app.scss). They also include some essential code for making it feel like an app on mobile.
- If you're coming from web development, learning that you cannot immediately redeploy when you have a bug fix, but first need to wait for approval from Apple or Google is something you have to get used to.
- On iOS, make sure that your app doesn't overlap with things like Battery Charging Status. You can achieve this with (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env)
- The [./build-and-deploy.sh](./build-and-deploy.sh) is something I've used for years. It looks like many devs in the hackathon struggled to host their projects. I usually use AWS Cloudfront for hosting, if you have some experience with AWS, this is certainly a good solution to host static pages, like for example those built with Svelte Kit SSG!
- This is going to sound ridiculous, but I found the hardest part about going from web to mobile generating all the required icons. There are tools that help with this, https://www.appicon.co/ is the best I've found. But it's still a struggle, if you get it wrong you cannot upload to the app store and things like that. This also shows me cool capacitor actually is, if that's the only thing that's left to do for me!
