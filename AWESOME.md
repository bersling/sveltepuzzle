# Awesome Tips & Tricks ðŸ˜Ž

- Capacitorjs is really great to go from webapp to mobile app in almost no time.
- The fastest way to test changes on mobile devices is with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can create a tunnel/link to your local machine and then test in the web browser of any device.
- Safari has a pretty neat sync between iOS devices and the safari browser on the local dev machine inspector over wifi. Just need to set it up with a couple of clicks. Instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZmD7asfpQ).
- Puppeteer is a great way to create thumbnail images of something. That way you can use your web & css skills to create things like icons and then convert to jpg format with puppeteer! See [icongenerator5000](./generators/icongenerator5000.ts).
- If you want to publish an app to iOS App Store / Google Play store, plan at least a weak in for the review process.
- If you upload apps to "App Store Connect" (apples platform for devs to release apps), and uploads fail without much information (just saying ERROR), reupload again with a tool called "Transporter". It gives more detailed error messages.
- I'm quite happy that I published "Svelte Puzzle" as my first apps for iOS and Android. It's much better to get some experience with the releasing rather than going for a release of a "big app" that's important to you right away!
- This is my code for handling touch `./src/routes/touch.ts`. It is an essential ingredient of making a web app compatible for a mobile release.
- Also check out `./src/app.html` and `./src/styles/app.scss`. They also include some essential code for making it feel like an app on mobile.
